# Weather Analysis for the Surf Up business

## Overview of Project
W. Avy has had a successful surf shop business in Oahu, HI. He is concedering partenring up to add to his business shakes (Shake and Surf). He wants to analyze and predect if the business will be successful in regards to the weather. We will provide him with analysis and trends based on previous years weather data.

### Purpose
Surf business owner wants to know information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on June and December: 
- We notice that there not much different in tempreture between June and December. Though, tempreture in december lower than summer time in few digits. Perhaps, in my oponio key factor for this type of business would be rain. Are people willing to surf while it's raining in December? or for the whole winter season for that matter. I'd suggest to W.Avy to include more weather data for any potential expansion of business.
